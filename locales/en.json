	"about-text": "I am a backend developer with experience in building scalable and efficient applications. My approach is based on using modern technologies and best practices to solve complex problems and deliver robust solutions. I have experience working with <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>, where I implement secure and optimized RESTful APIs to meet client needs. Additionally, I am skilled in using <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for efficient database management, ensuring data integrity and fast queries. I specialize in writing clean and maintainable code and use tools like <strong>Sass</strong> to ensure a flexible and stylish web design, maintaining consistency and scalability in projects. While my primary focus is backend development, I have strong knowledge of <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, allowing me to collaborate across all layers of the application to create functional and attractive user experiences. I am always learning and looking for new ways to improve my workflow and technical skills, aiming to deliver final products that are both efficient and easy to maintain in the long term.",
